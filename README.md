Midpoint is a map tool for calculating convenient meeting locations between friends. It is written in Javascript and implements Google Maps API.

Finding a place to hang out can be difficult. Meeting up with friends who are all an hour train ride away from each other is almost impossible. Midpoint makes it easy to decide where to gather by using location methods, transit preferences, and simple math to determine which location makes the most sense for a group of spread out friends.

## Features

All features in Midpoint are centered around the main map. Users can add several locations with tag names in the upper left hand corner and use the other features for calculating a number of interesting points of interest.

### Geographical Midpoint

The first feature of Midpoint is finding the exact geographical midpoint between several locations. By calculating the latitude and longitude of all entered locations, Midpoint calculates the mathematical average of both and reveals the exact center.
